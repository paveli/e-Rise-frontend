How to test

1. Install Waves Keeper (a browser extension that allows users to manage their private keys and interact with our platform) switch to operation in Test Network

2. At the moment our smart  contract is deployed in Test Network. This network allows user to acquire test WAVES tokens with help of built in Faucet tool. 

You need to copy your address, paste it in relevant field, confirm that you're a human :wink: and press button 'Request 10 waves'. Relax and wait for your 10 waves to be dropped in your wallet within few minutes.

3. Feel free to send waves to a project which appeals to you.
