# MISSION

Here at e-Rise.org we believe that there is a way to make communities great again :) We've build a blockchain powered platform for crowdfunding. It will be used by a community of Estonian e-residents in order to get members from all around the world communicate with each other and make room for synergy of a community.

# STORY

Our story starts under full moon on Friday, 13th :) 2019 when we met each other at Garage48 Digital Nation Hackathon. And that's when the magic started to happen. This section will be updated later, after we actually win the hackathon and go further.
